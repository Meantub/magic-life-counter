# Magic Life Counter

This was a project I did in 2018 in my freshman year of college, the idea was to replicate the apps that I had on android for keeping track of the life I had in the game Magic the Gathering.

It is unfinished but I believe I got as far as being able to count up 2 different player's life totals. Basically I started it in mind to be able to handle N number of people playing at once. This was due to my friend group that played it having more than most apps would be able to handle, 4.
